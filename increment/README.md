# increment

A simple program that lets any user increment a counter as many times as they want.

Basically just the example from https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-solana-development-with-react-anchor-rust-and-phantom-3291, but modified to use PDAs (see https://www.brianfriel.xyz/understanding-program-derived-addresses/ for that).
